        <p>It started when I sent my son to a Montessori preschool where I found Dr Montessori's book <i>The Secret of Childhool</i>.  It opened 
          up a new and interesting view of childhood development. Since then, I was hooked.  I even earned my Master Degree in Montessori Education
          while working full-time as a banking sofware consultant.  It helps me as a parent to find the potentials of my children.  It helps me to be 
          a better parent.  It helps me to be a better person. Allowance, patience and role-modeling are a few of the many virtues in Montessori Method.
          I started to watch my tone, my behavior and my temper.  It is no wonder Dr Maria Montessori was nominated three times for the Peace Nobel Prize.

      <h1><strong>Montessori Theory :</strong></h1>
      <br>
      <div class="mont_text">
      <p>The Montessori Method of Education, developed by Maria Montessori, is a child-centered educational approach based on scientific 
        observations of children. Montessori's method has been used for over 100 years in many parts of the world.
        The Montessori method views the child as the one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a 
        supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. It attempts to develop children physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Montessori observed four distinct periods, or "planes", in human development, extending from birth to 6 years, from 6 to 12, from 12 to 18, 
        and from 18 to 24. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes, and called
        for educational approaches specific to each period.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking 
        physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental 
        work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, 
        including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Finally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed "normalization". Normalization arises
        from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child's developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as
        well as "spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others."</p>
          <br>
        <p>The second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and 
          psychological changes in children, and developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. 
          Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of 
          uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the "herd instinct", or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as 
          the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second plane child is the formation of intellectual 
          independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of adolescence.
        Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of puberty and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized 
        the psychological instability and difficulties in concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of 
        "a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity." She used the term "valorization" to describe the adolescents' drive for an externally 
        derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the 
        adult self in society.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>The fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori believed the study of 
          culture could go on throughout a person's life.
